# FizeauExperimentSimulation
Simulation of the Fizeau's Experiment - Java project

Fizeau's Experiment was performed in order to measure speed of light using a set of mirrors and a rotating toothed wheel.
Knowing the angular speed of the wheel and the distant from the wheel to the mirror Fizeau was able to calculate the speed of light in the 19th century.
The goal of this simulation is to replicate the experiment allowing the user to set all the parameters and measure amount of light that reaches the reciever.

This simulation is being created for a school project.
